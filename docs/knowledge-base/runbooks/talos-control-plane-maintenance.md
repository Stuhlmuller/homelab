# Talos Control-Plane Maintenance

Tags: #runbook #talos #maintenance

Canonical runbook: [`docs/talos-control-plane-maintenance.md`](../../talos-control-plane-maintenance.md)

Render and validate Talos configuration before applying it. Use
`talosctl validate --mode metal --strict`, authenticated access after bootstrap,
and repository-owned patches for control-plane changes.
Direct-IP `talosctl` operations require the homelab LAN or retained Tailscale
fallback; the Octelium Kubernetes Service and Cordium session do not route the
Talos API or LAN subnet.

For remote ZimaBoard recovery, the canonical runbook maps each worker to its
Talos address and uses authenticated `talosctl reboot`; reboot one worker at a
time only from a healthy cluster, verify node and cluster-wide workload
readiness, and never fall back to `--insecure`.

The canonical runbook also owns the dated 2026-08-25 corrupt-object recovery.
That recovery is exact-key and snapshot-first, with a Talos snapshot-restore
rollback; do not generalize it into a routine etcd mutation path.

See [[../architecture/cluster-topology]] and [[validation]].
